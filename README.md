# CUNE-VN-Engine
Customizable Universal Novel Engine (My first game engine that's versatile)
All you need is a Python installation or a Venv in PyCharm. My engine "should" automatically install PyGame.
You can disable it by removing the line. Since it is my first game engine I'll leave it open source. 
I want to keep adding features and making it advanced so even you can make cool things with it.
Since there ARE a limited amount of options for visual novel game engines, hopefully, mine would be simple-
to understand since the functions are self-explanatory, are named appropriately, and are easy to use.
I want to make the simplest, light-weight, and self-explanatory Visual novel engine that just
gets to the point and lets you do your thing.
